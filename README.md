# CS 207: Arduino Project
This repository is going to consist of the code used for the project I've done over the Fall 2019 semester for CS207, as well as the materials used and on how to replicate it.


I will be basing my project off of a project done by Jason Poel Smith from makezine.com. His project comprises of a toy water gun that shoots water out to anyone who may walk in front of it. It utilizes an infrared motion sensor and an Arduino. When a person walks in front of the infrared sensor, the infrared sensor sends a signal to the Arduino which in turn activates a relay that is connected to the trigger and it then fires the gun. 


The original project is a stationary gun turret. The modification I want to add is that it has mobility as well. My idea is to construct an ultrasonic car that avoids obstacles in front of it and the water turret will be mounted on top of it. My plan is that as the motion turret is moving around in the ultrasonic car, when the infrared sensor sees something walking in front, it will stop and shoot out water for 2-3 seconds and then start moving again. If the ultrasonic sensor sees an obstacle, such as a wall it is heading towards, it will stop and redirect itself to avoid a crash.


I will be following an ultrasonic car project done by a user called “DIY Builder” on YouTube. I liked his version of the project the best, and the way he did it was in a fairly simple and neat way compared to some others.
