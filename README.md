# CS 207: Arduino Project
This repository is going to consist of the code used for the project I've done over the Fall 2019 semester for CS207, as well as the materials used and on how to replicate it.


I will be basing my project off of a project done by Jason Poel Smith from makezine.com. His project comprises of a toy water gun that shoots water out to anyone who may walk in front of it. It utilizes an infrared motion sensor and an Arduino. When a person walks in front of the PIR sensor, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino which in turn activates a relay that is connected to the trigger and it then fires the gun. 


Along with that, I wanted to mount the turret on top of an ultrasonic vehicle. That way, it will be a mobile turret hunting down people to shoot water at. I will be following an ultrasonic car project done by a user called “DIY Builder” on YouTube. I liked his version of the project the best, and the way he did it was in a fairly simple and neat manner compared to some other projects I've seen
